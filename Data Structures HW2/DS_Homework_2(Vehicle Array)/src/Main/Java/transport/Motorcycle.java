        // 2: The super constructor is ALWAYS the first thing called in a subclass' constructor
        // 3: The subclass constructor only needs parameters for relevant data. This can be fewer or more things than the super constructor needs.
        //      However, the super constructor still requires the data necessary to create an object of the parent class (a vehicle still needs data for a vehicle)
